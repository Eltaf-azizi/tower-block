Each block moves horizontally across the screen, and you must click or tap to drop it onto the stack below.

<h4>Controls:</h4>
Drop a Block: Click with your mouse or tap on the screen to drop a block from its moving position onto the tower below. The aim is to align it as perfectly as possible with the top block of the tower.
Restart the Game: Refresh your web browser to start over and try to beat your previous score.
<h4>Tips for High Scores</h4>
Timing is Key: The secret to a tall tower is timing your clicks or taps precisely to ensure the blocks land directly on top of each other.
Practice Makes Perfect: The more you play, the better you'll get at judging the moving blocks' speed and timing your drops.
Enjoy building the tallest tower you can, and challenge yourself to beat your high scores!
